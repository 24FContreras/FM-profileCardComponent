### What I learned

The main thing I learned while resolving this challenge lays on the background of the body. I've never positioned two elements before as a background image, so I had to research a bit. I'm happy I learned how to do it, as I'm sure it will an useful tool in future projects.

```scss
//BODY BACKGROUND
background-color: $dark-cyan;
background-image: url(../img/bg-pattern-top.svg),
  url(../img/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
background-position: right 50vw bottom 50vh, left 50vw top 50vh;
```
